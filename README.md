Creating a random password generator

As the project asked I created an application that generated a random password after the user selected their parameters for said password.

I know there isn't a wrong or right way of doing things so I just thought out the process and executed it that way. 

I used if and else for every condition, I also added a two addition prompts to ensure the user stayed between the 8 and 128 character parameter. 

I then used a for loop with math.random to randomize the data produced and I used math.floor to round to the whole number.
