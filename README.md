Creating a random password generator

As the project asked I created an application that generated a random password after the user selected their parameters for said password.

I know there isn't a wrong or right way of doing things so I just thought out the process and executed it that way. 

I got the end result I was looking although I'm sure there are other ways of doing so this is what I did.
